👩‍💻 About This Repository

This repository documents my hands-on projects, system designs, and applied learnings from the Professional Certificate Programme in Agentic AI and Applications offered by IITM Pravartak.

The focus of this portfolio is:

Agentic AI system design

Multi-agent orchestration

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Tool-using AI agents

Memory-enabled conversational systems

Hallucination-safe AI architectures

Production-grade modular AI development

This is not a collection of notebooks — it is a structured progression toward building reliable, goal-driven AI systems.

📈 Learning Evolution

Through this programme, I am transitioning from:

Using AI tools → Designing AI systems

Key shifts in thinking:

From prompt writing → to architecture design

From chatbot usage → to controlled AI pipelines

From experimentation → to system reliability

From model output → to explainability and confidence scoring

📌 What This Portfolio Represents

This repository reflects:

Applied understanding of Agentic AI

Practical system-building capability

Engineering discipline in LLM integration

Ability to move from theory to working systems
